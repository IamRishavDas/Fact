<body>
    <div class="facts"><ul>The name "Java" was inspired by the name of the coffee that the creators of the language used to drink.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's syntax was influenced by C and C++, but it also borrowed concepts from other languages like Smalltalk.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>The latest stable release of Java as of my last update is Java 17.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java has a rich set of libraries and frameworks, such as Java Standard Edition (SE), Enterprise Edition (EE), and Micro Edition (ME).</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java is commonly used for building web applications, mobile apps, desktop applications, and large-scale enterprise systems.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>The Java Development Kit (JDK) includes tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can then be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>The JVM is responsible for interpreting bytecode and translating it into machine code that the underlying hardware can execute.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>The JVM provides features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), security, and platform independence.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's garbage collector automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use, reducing the risk of memory leaks.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java supports multithreading, allowing programs to execute multiple tasks concurrently.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java introduced the concept of checked exceptions, which forces developers to handle potential errors at compile time.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's platform independence is achieved through the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run Java applications on a computer.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java applications can be deployed as standalone executable files or as web applications running within a web browser.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's object-oriented features include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's inheritance model supports single inheritance for classes and multiple inheritance for interfaces.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Interfaces in Java allow for the implementation of multiple inheritance by specifying a contract that classes must adhere to.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java interfaces can include method declarations without method bodies, leaving the implementation to the classes that implement the interface.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "final" keyword can be used to prevent inheritance, method overriding, or variable modification.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "static" keyword allows methods and variables to be accessed without creating an instance of the class.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "abstract" keyword allows for the creation of abstract classes and methods that must be implemented by subclasses.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java supports method overloading, allowing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists to coexist within the same class.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java supports method overriding, allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation of methods defined in the superclass.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java supports autoboxing and unboxing, which automatically converts between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.</ul></div>

    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "throws" keyword is used to declare that a method may throw a particular type of exception, which must be handled by the caller or propagated to the next level of the call stack.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "throw" keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method or constructor.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "assert" keyword is used to test assumptions in code during development and is typically disabled in production environments.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java supports annotations, which allow metadata to be added to code elements like classes, methods, and fields.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's reflection API allows for the inspection and modification of classes, methods, and fields at runtime.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's serialization mechanism allows objects to be converted into a stream of bytes for storage or transmission and then reconstructed back into objects.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "native" keyword allows for the integration of native code written in languages like C and C++ into Java programs.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "synchronized" keyword allows for the creation of synchronized blocks and methods, which are used to control access to shared resources in multithreaded environments.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "volatile" keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by multiple threads and should not be cached by thread-local storage.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "transient" keyword is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized when an object is serialized.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "strictfp" keyword ensures that floating-point calculations produce consistent results across different platforms by enforcing strict rules for floating-point arithmetic.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "break" statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "continue" statement is used to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "assert" statement is used to test assumptions in code and can be enabled or disabled at runtime using command-line options.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "instanceof" operator is used to test whether an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "super" keyword is used to access members of the superclass from within a subclass.</ul></div>
    <div class="facts"><ul>Java's "this" keyword is used to refer to the current object instance within a class or method.</ul></div>
